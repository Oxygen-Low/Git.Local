# Git.Local
Locally runnable alternative to Github and Gitlab.

note: Currently developing on Github, since it's easier to start a Github repository than use other things, since it has more integrations and CI available than file explorer.

I will move this to a different host when I feel like its ready (so a github alternative isn't being hosted on github)
